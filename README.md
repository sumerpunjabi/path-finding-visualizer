# Pathfinding Visualizer

## Description
This Pathfinding Visualizer is an interactive web application designed to demonstrate and visualize various pathfinding algorithms. It offers a user-friendly platform for exploring different algorithms' behavior in finding the shortest path in a maze or grid.

You can access the application [here](https://sumerpunjabi.github.io/pathfinding-visualizer/).

## Features
- **Multiple Algorithms**: Supports Dijkstra's, A*, JPS with more to come.
- **Randomizer Grid**: Users can create random grids/mazes for pathfinding.
- **Step-by-Step Visualization**: Observe each algorithm's step-by-step process.
- **Algorithm Comparison**: Easily switch to compare performance and paths.

## How to Use
1. Select an algorithm from the left side.
2. Press 'Visualize' to begin visualization.
3. Use 'Clear' to clear and restart.

## Technologies Used
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- React for UI
- Redux for state management
